# --- settings hyperv_vm (windsorcli/hyperv 0.4.0) does not expose, plus the VM's actual start --
#
# Checkpoint type, automatic start/stop action, and integration-service
# toggles are not arguments of hyperv_vm in this provider version -- its own
# docs say outright: "Integration services, automatic start/stop actions,
# and checkpoints are not currently exposed." The prior taliesins/hyperv
# configuration set all of these inline; asserting them here, once per VM
# via the Hyper-V PowerShell module directly (not the Terraform/OpenTofu
# provider), is the explicit safeguard for the one setting that is
# safety-critical for this cluster:
#
#   checkpoint_type = Disabled -- restoring a checkpoint of an etcd member
#   rewinds its log and can corrupt the cluster; rebuild the VM instead.
#   A newly created Hyper-V VM defaults to "Production" checkpoints.
#
# CONFIRMED, not hypothetical (2026-09-26): checkpoint type alone is not
# enough. "Automatic Checkpoints" is a SEPARATE Hyper-V setting (on by
# default) that takes a checkpoint at every VM start regardless of
# checkpoint type, until AutomaticCheckpointsEnabled is turned off. With
# hyperv_vm.vm created already Running (an earlier revision of this file),
# two lab VMs each took an automatic checkpoint at their first boot -- before
# this null_resource ever got a chance to disable checkpoints -- silently
# turning hard_disk_drive.path into a GUID-suffixed .avhdx (an active
# differencing disk), which the provider then reported as "Provider produced
# inconsistent result after apply". Fixed by (a) hyperv_vm.vm now creating
# the VM powered OFF (state.desired = "Off", above) and (b) this resource
# both disabling Automatic Checkpoints AND starting the VM itself, in that
# order, so a checkpoint can never be taken before checkpoints are disabled.
#
# automatic_start_action/automatic_stop_action and the integration-service
# set are asserted in the same call for parity with what taliesins/hyperv
# declared before, not because they are safety-critical the way checkpoints
# are.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, not silently assumed away: this runs once, when the VM
# is created or replaced (the trigger is the VM's id) -- it does NOT detect
# or correct drift afterward. If checkpoint type, Automatic Checkpoints, or
# these other settings are changed out-of-band later (Hyper-V Manager, a
# backup product, Windows Update), this resource has no way to notice.
# Re-run `tofu apply -replace='null_resource.vm_unmanaged_settings["<name>"]'`,
# or add a periodic drift check outside Terraform/OpenTofu, if that risk
# matters for this lab.
